Hi!! My name is Donald Casson and i live in Brisbane Australia.  

This is my second attempt at writing a blog :) The first one went to the weeds, hopefully i have the right choice of software and workflow this times so there is no excuse. 

I am also NOT some wierd reincarnation of pydanny (`pydanny.com`_) .  My nickname is Donny and i just put 'py' in front of it and the domain was availble :)

This blog will include things that i am working on with clients or part of my own personal/business interests

Some topics i will be touching on:

* How this blog (`pelican`_)  was made and hosted (`github`_)
* python (`python.org`_)
* django (`django`_) 
* devops
* golang (`golang`_)
* whatever else i feel like writing about at the time
