Making News Year's Resolutions is something I do every year. It's important to me. I like to set goals and see how well I do.

Resolutions
===========

* Write and publish fiction. This is a childhood dream that I would like to do.
* Write and publish as least one new technical book, preferably on Python.
* Release the second edition of Two Scoops of Django.
* Learn Haskell or some other interesting programming language.
* Figure out a way I can make money working in open source efforts. As a consultant, this explains why I don't do it more.
* Visit the three continents I've yet to see. That means South America, Africa, and Antarctica.
* Visit at least one new nation. It's hard to come up with preferences since the whole world is so exciting.
* Go back to places I've visited before. For example, Italy, Philippines, and the states where I grew up.
* Take road trips around the USA.
* See the Grand Canyon.
* Visit more family.
* Do 1000 push-ups or similar exercises in a single day. I'm at 300 now.
* Pull off an Aú sem Mão (no-handed cartwheel).
* Blog once a week. That is at least 52 blog entries!
* Take a fun class with Audrey.
* Upload all my outstanding pictures to Flickr!
* Learn how to surf or snowboard.
* See all my friends. All of them.
* Work less and enjoy life with Audrey more.
